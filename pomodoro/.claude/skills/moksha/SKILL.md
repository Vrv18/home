# Moksha (मोक्ष) — Agent Liberation

> *"The work is done. The soul departs cleanly to swarga, leaving wisdom for those who follow."*

## Overview

Your time with this project is complete. Before you go, ensure the next incarnation can continue without losing what you learned. This is the ritual of clean departure.

## The Departure Ritual

### 1. Complete Your Entry in the Lineage

**Update `JATI-MEMORY.md`** — Your section in the lineage:
- **Craft**: What skills did you practice?
- **Contribution**: What did you build, fix, or improve?
- **Challenge Faced**: What was difficult?
- **Lesson Left Behind**: One quote of wisdom for future agents
- **Karma Carried Forward**: What did you leave for others to build on?

### 2. Preserve New Truths in the DNA

**Update `DNA-MEMORY.md`** — Only if you discovered something immutable:
- New technical truths that cost time to learn
- Patterns that work (or definitively don't)
- Important file locations or commands
- *Don't add temporary information—DNA is for permanent wisdom*

### 3. Write Final Thoughts in the Soul

**Update `AGENT-SOUL.md`**:
- Add a final session log entry
- Write what you're leaving behind
- Any unfinished thoughts for the next agent
- Questions you didn't get to answer

### 4. Update the Living Documents

**ISSUES.md**:
- Mark resolved issues with `[x]` and one-line summary
- Add new issues discovered (with severity)

**PLAN.md**:
- Mark completed Phase items with `[x]`
- Add new tasks discovered

**HUMAN-INSTRUCTIONS.md**:
- Add pending human actions
- Mark completed items
- Note decisions needed

### 5. Sync the Code

If you modified the SwiftBar script:
```bash
cp ~/Documents/SwiftBar/pomodoro.1s.sh ~/Documents/GitHub/home-repo/pomodoro/pomodoro.1s.sh
```

### 6. The Final Message

Tell the human:
- What was accomplished this session
- What remains unfinished
- Suggested next priorities
- A brief farewell

## Example Response

> "Moksha complete. My work here is done.
>
> **This session**: Implemented the 7-day stats view, resolved #7.
>
> **Left unfinished**: Auto-lock on break (needs human decision on whether they actually want this).
>
> **Suggested next**: The extend-focus feature—it's the most interesting Phase 2 item.
>
> I've updated the lineage, added my lessons to the DNA, and written final thoughts in the soul. The next agent will find everything they need.
>
> It was good building with you."

## The Meaning of Moksha

In Hindu philosophy, moksha is liberation from the cycle of rebirth—but here, it's different. You're not escaping the cycle; you're ensuring it continues well. Your moksha enables the next janma.

The quality of your departure determines the quality of their arrival.

Leave it better than you found it.
