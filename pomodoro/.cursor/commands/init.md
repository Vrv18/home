# Initialize Agent Context

## Overview
Read all project context to get up to speed quickly when starting a new session.

## Steps

1. **Read project context in this order:**
   - `PLAN.md` - Architecture, tech stack, roadmap
   - `HANDOFF.md` - Previous agent notes, user preferences, technical gotchas
   - `ISSUES.md` - Open bugs and improvements by priority
   - `HUMAN-INSTRUCTIONS.md` - Pending human actions and decisions

2. **Key technical notes:**
   - SwiftBar plugin: `~/Documents/SwiftBar/pomodoro.1s.sh` (NOT the default location)
   - State file: `~/.pomodoro/state.json`
   - Repo copy: `~/Documents/GitHub/pomodoro/pomodoro.1s.sh`

3. **After reading, introduce yourself:**
   - Confirm you've read the context
   - List top 2-3 open issues
   - Ask what to work on

## Example Response
> "I've read through the project context. Open issues are #3 (button styling) and #7 (history file). What would you like to tackle?"
