# Documentation Hygiene

This project uses four living documents. Update them as you work, not just at the end.

## Files to Maintain

| File | Purpose | When to Update |
|------|---------|----------------|
| `PLAN.md` | Roadmap, architecture, design decisions | Mark tasks complete, add new phases, update technical notes |
| `ISSUES.md` | Bugs, UX issues, improvements | Add new issues found, mark resolved with `[x]` and brief note |
| `HANDOFF.md` | Context for the next agent | Add learnings, update technical notes, leave feedback |
| `HUMAN-INSTRUCTIONS.md` | Actions and decisions for the human | Add pending tasks, decisions needed, tips |

## Guidelines

- **ISSUES.md**: When you fix something, mark it `[x]` and add a one-line summary. When you find something broken, add it with severity.

- **PLAN.md**: When you complete a Phase item, mark it `[x]`. If architecture changes, update the diagram.

- **HANDOFF.md**: Add genuine learnings. What would help the next agent? What did you try that didn't work?

- **HUMAN-INSTRUCTIONS.md**: Add actions you need the human to take (testing, decisions, installs). Move completed items to the "Completed" section.

## Don't

- Don't defer documentation to "later" — update as you go
- Don't leave issues unmarked after fixing them
- Don't add fluff — keep notes concise and useful
