A native macOS menu bar application designed to reclaim your attention. More than a timer, it is a ritual.

Inspired by the **Hoysala** architecture of Karnataka—grounded, intricate, and harmonious.  
We believe productivity is not about speed, but about depth. This tool respectfully guards that depth.

## ✨ Features

### 🏛 The Sanctuary
When a Focus session (25m) completes, the screen gently blooms into a full-screen, immersive break space.
- **Deep Breathing**: Follow the rhythmic expansion of the lotus.
- **Total Focus**: No notifications. No distractions. Just you and the breath.
- **Auto-Exit**: The Sanctuary dissolves when your break ends.

### 👁️ Micro-Breaks
Every 5 minutes during focus, a gentle 10-second reminder appears.
- **Eye Care**: Prompts you to look away from the screen (20-20-20 rule)
- **Non-Intrusive**: Auto-dismisses after 10 seconds
- **Random Tips**: Rotating messages about eye care, stretching, and breathing

### ⏱ Calm Mode
Feeling overwhelmed? Click **Calm Mode** in the menu to enter the Sanctuary instantly, without a timer. Stay as long as you need. "Forfeit" logic is replaced by "End Calm" grace.

### 🧱 Inline History
Track your consistency without leaving the flow. The menu bar displays a 7-day sparkline of your focus history using Unicode blocks: `History: ▂ ▃ ▅ █`

### 🪶 Native Performance
- **Rust + Tauri**: Blazing fast.
- **<10MB RAM**: Respects your system resources.
- **0% CPU Idle**: Respects your battery.
